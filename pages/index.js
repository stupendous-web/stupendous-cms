            As a noob developer, I was frustrated with that lack of platforms
            that would allow my clients to manager their content while allowing
            me to insert it easily into their project via an API at an
            affordable cost. Yeah! Yeah! Wordpress, right? Blah! Blah!
            Let&apos;s do better! PHP is ðŸ’€! Stupendous CMS is a hosted,
            headless content management system built with Javascript and
            MongoDB. Your clients can login and easily manage their content and
            you can access it through your REST API. Let&apos;s go!
