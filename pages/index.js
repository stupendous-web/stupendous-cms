            <p>
              As a noob developer, I was frustrated with that lack of platforms
              that would allow my clients to manager their content while
              allowing me to insert it easily into their project via an API at
              an affordable cost. Yeah! Yeah! Wordpress, right? Blah! Blah!
              Let&apos;s do better! PHP is ðŸ’€! Stupendous CMS is a hosted,
              headless content management system built with Javascript and
              MongoDB. Your clients can login and easily manage their content
              and you can access it through your REST API. Let&apos;s go!

                <h3>Cloud Hosted</h3>
                <p>
                  Make things easy for your clients and yourself! You can host
                  and manage all your content, media, and JSON endpoints right
                  here.
                </p>

                <h3>REST API</h3>
                <p>
                  This is a developer&apos;s dream. Your REST API is accessible
                  through your own custom endpoints and your media is hosted via
                  the Stupendous CMS Google Cloud Storage account.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Project and Content Management</h3>
                <p>
                  Keep it cool! Stay organized by managing your content by type
                  and into projects that your clients can easily access.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Media</h3>
                <p>
                  That&apos;s right! You can upload media as well and access it
                  through a Google Cloud endpoint in your API.
